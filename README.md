## Hi there, I am Bavna Rajan ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science at Columbia University, where I blend my passion for storytelling with rigorous data analysis. I believe that every dataset has a hidden narrativeâ€”one that can be uncovered by asking the right questions and approaching the data from the right angle. 

Background: I earned my undergraduate degree in Mathematics in Chennai, India.\
Passion: Data storytellingâ€”transforming raw data into compelling narratives that drive meaningful decisions.\
Current Focus: Exploring projects in machine learning, data visualization, and quantitative analysis. Experimenting with different techniques to uncover meaningful insights from the data\
Fun fact: I can impersonate people really well :))\
Feel free to check out my projects or get in touch if you'd like to collaborate!
